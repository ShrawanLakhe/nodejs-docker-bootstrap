# nodejs-docker-bootstrap
This is a sample project that implements a basic nodejs rest api server that uses mariadb. It shows a way of dockerizing a nodejs application both for production and local development.

It features **hot reloading**, **pre-populating a database**, **building a single runnable docker image**.
